      My started programming in VBA at work. The places I worked mostly were
      using spreadsheets from the 90s and early 2000s which require a lot of
      updates and migration of features. I worked on some of these projects and
      soon became interested in programming/coding and I was fascinated by what
      programming can achieve to automate my workflows.
