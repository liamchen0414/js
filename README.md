Note: Divisions 1 to 13 each includes a question which allows the person completing the checklist to indicate the whole division is not applicable. It is not required to tick each “not applicable” box in the Division. If, for example, the law practice has not received, disbursed or held controlled money then a tick will be placed in “Not Applicable” and move to the next Division.																									
"2.         The review period is 1 April to 31 March. The applicable legislation (unless otherwise indicated) is
the  Legal  Profession  Uniform  Law  (NSW)  (“LPUL”)  and  the  Legal Profession  Uniform  General Rules 2015 (“LPUGR”), both of which commenced on 1 July 2015."																									
"Examiners will note that the checklist records some breaches with “-“ at the end of the breach
followed by a number. This has been introduced for Rules with more than one requirement for the record. It now allows the Examiner to report only that piece of information that is not recorded in the required record."																									
"3.          The External Examiner’s Report is required to be completed by a person who is registered as a
designated person with the designated local regulatory authority."																									
"4.          Upon being appointed as an Examiner by a law practice, the Examiner should remind the law practice  of  its  obligation  to  notify  the  designated  local  regulatory  authority  in  writing  of  such appointment if they have not already done so. A notification form – Notification of Appointment or Cessation  of  External  Examiner  is  available  on  the  website  of  the  designated  local  regulatory authority.
5.          The Checklist has been prepared to guide the law practice and Examiners through the examination of the various forms of trust records maintained by the law practice and to assist in the assessment of compliance with the legislation. The use of the Checklist is not mandatory.
6.          A completed copy of the Checklist together with other review documentation should be retained by the Examiner as part of his/her work papers.
7.          The Examiner should apply professional judgement together with the various standards prescribed by the professional bodies which cover the individual circumstances of each examination.
8.          The objective of the Checklist is to assist the Examiner to form an opinion, amongst other things, as to whether:
(a)       any information recorded in the law practice’s Law Practice Confirmation and Statement of Trust Money is not true;
(b)       any overdrawing of trust money was restored, and appropriate action promptly taken;
(c)       the trust records for the various types of trust money have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the LPUL and the LPUGR;
(d)       all necessary trust records were produced to the Examiner as requested for the purpose of the examination and that the records were kept in a way that enables the records to be conveniently and properly externally examined; and
(e)       the trust records have been kept in a way that at all times discloses the true position in relation to trust money received by the law practice.
9.          It is necessary to conduct appropriate examination, sampling techniques and enquiries to form an opinion as to whether the accounting records have been maintained in accordance with the LPUL and  the  LPUGR.  Examiners  must  use  their  own  judgement,  from  the  examination  of  the  trust records, to form an opinion. The designated local regulatory authorities will not offer advice as to whether an issue in the records warrants a breach of the LPUL or the LPUGR or a qualified report.
10.        Breaches  of  the  LPUL  and  the  LPUGR  are  to  be  recorded  on  Schedule  1  of  the  External Examiner’s Report with suitable comments as to the dates and particulars of the recorded breach if applicable.
11.        The name of the law practice should be accurately recorded in the Law Practice Confirmation - Part A and the Statement of Trust Money - Law Practice - Part B. Any change to the name of the law practice during the relevant period may require a separate External Examiner’s Report to be prepared.  If  further  information  is  required,  please  contact  the  Law  Society’s  Trust  Accounts Department.
12.        All authorised signatories to the general trust account at any time during the examination period should be listed in paragraph 5 of the Statement of Trust Money - Law Practice - Part B.
13.       All  general  trust  accounts  operated  during  the  examination  period  must  be  included  in  the Statement of Trust Money - Law Practice - Part B in the table at paragraph 1 headed 'General Trust  Account',  as  well  as  the  balance  of  each  from  the  Authorised  ADI  Statement  and  the Reconciled Authorised ADI Balance as at 31 March. The table must also include any accounts that were opened or closed during the examination period, including any accounts which had a change in BSB number due to the change or closure of the relevant branch of the authorised ADI.
14.        A listing of authorised ADI’s is available on the designated local regulatory authority’s website -for New    South    Wales:    https://www.lawsociety.com.au/practising-law-in-NSW/trust-money-and- fidelity-funds/authorised-deposit-taking-institutions"																									
																									
"15.        Ascertain  all general trust  accounts, controlled money accounts, accounts subject to a power, written directions to deal with trust money, and details of any investment of trust money disclosed by the accounting records which will be subject to the Checklist. Details should be summarised in the Statement of Trust Money - Law Practice - Part B.
16.        Transit Money (Division 4) - There is no particular accounting records or register required by the LPUL  to  be  maintained  for  transit  money. It should  be noted  that Section  143(1) of the LPUL requires transit money received in the form of cash to be deposited in the first instance to  the general trust account. Section 155(4) of the LPUL provides that if the only trust money received or held by a law practice during a financial year is transit money, the practice's trust records in respect of that year are not required to be externally examined. In addition to transit money, a law practice is not required to have its trust records externally examined if it has only received or held trust money subject to a specific power pursuant to an electronic lodgement network operator's settlement scheme (such as PEXA) and/or trust money subject to a written direction.
17.        Trust Money Subject to a Power – Paragraph 3 of the Statement of Trust Money - Law Practice - Part B requires the recording of the total value of trust money subject to a specific power as at 31 March. If a precise figure cannot be determined, then an approximation should be recorded, or otherwise record “0.00”.
18.        The decision as to whether paid cheques need to be sighted, or other transactions be verified, or the balance of the authorised ADI account be verified is left to the discretion of the Examiner. The method and number of transactions selected for review is determined by each Examiner. If the Examiner  is  satisfied  that  the  source  records  substantiate  the  payment  transactions,  then  the Examiner may determine that the sighting of paid cheques is not required.
19.        In relation to the calculation of the statutory deposit, the designated local authority in New South Wales  does  not  require  the  External  Examiner  to  check  the  calculation  but  to  confirm  that  a calculation has been made in the relevant applicable period(s) and the amount held on statutory deposit is supported by an authorised ADI document.
The External Examiner’s Report must be lodged with the designated local regulatory authority - the Law Society Council by 31 May to ensure processing and that any matters arising may be addressed within the financial year. If 31 May falls on a Saturday or Sunday or a public holiday, the External Examiner’s Report may then be lodged on the next business day. If the External Examiner’s Report is delayed as a result of an authorised ADI’s delay in providing information, Examiners are requested to lodge the External Examiner’s  Report  with  a  note  in  paragraph  7  of  the  Report  advising  that  the  Examiner  is  awaiting information from the authorised ADI. After the receipt of the information from the authorised ADI, if the Examiner is of the opinion that it needs to be drawn to the attention of the designated local regulatory authority, the Examiner should notify the information to the Chief Trust Account Investigator, Law Society of New South Wales, 170 Phillip Street Sydney NSW 2000 or by email to tad@lawsociety.com.au. The Examiner is required to submit the External Examiner’s Report via the online lodgement system. A copy
should be provided to the law practice."
